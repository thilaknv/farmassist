          <CardDescription>
            NPK refers to the three essential nutrients that are crucial for
            plant growth. NPK values in soil indicate the amount of nitrogen
            (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) present, essential for plant
            growth and often displayed on fertilizer labels to guide nutrient
            management.

                Nitrogen is essential for the formation of proteins,
                chlorophyll, and other cell components. It promotes healthy leaf
                and stem growth.

              <AccordionContent>
                Phosphorus is important for root development, flowering, and
                fruiting. It also plays a role in energy transfer within the
                plant.

              <AccordionContent>
                Potassium is involved in photosynthesis and regulates water
                uptake and retention. It contributes to overall plant vigor and
                disease resistance.
