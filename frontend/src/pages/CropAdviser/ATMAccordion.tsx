          <CardDescription>
            Atmospheric factors such as temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall
            directly influence plant growth and health by affecting metabolic
            processes, water availability, nutrient uptake, and overall
            resilience to environmental stress. Understanding and managing these
            factors are crucial for optimizing agricultural productivity and
            ecosystem stability.

              <AccordionContent>
                Temperature affects plant growth in several ways. Different
                plants have optimal temperature ranges for growth, and extremes
                can cause stress or damage. Temperature influences metabolic
                rates, flowering times, and the ability to photosynthesize.

              <AccordionTrigger>Humidity</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Humidity refers to the amount of moisture in the air. High
                humidity can affect transpiration rates (the loss of water vapor
                from leaves) and may promote certain diseases. Low humidity can
                lead to increased water loss from plants.

              <AccordionTrigger>pH</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                pH measures the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. It affects
                nutrient availability to plants; different plants have different
                pH preferences. For example, acidic soils (low pH) may limit the
                availability of nutrients like phosphorus, while alkaline soils
                (high pH) may limit the availability of micronutrients.

              <AccordionTrigger>Rainfall</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Rainfall provides plants with water, which is essential for
                photosynthesis, nutrient transport, and cell turgidity.
                Different plants have different water requirements, and rainfall
                patterns can affect plant distribution and growth. Too much or
                too little rainfall can stress plants and affect crop yields.
